# Code Obfuscator

Code Obfuscator is a tool built with React and TypeScript, using Material-UI for the interface. This application allows you to obfuscate sensitive data from the code before sending it to ChatGPT. After receiving the response back, I can use the same tool to deobfuscate the data back to its original form.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Usage
To obfuscate your code, input the sensitive names (separated by commas) and your code in the respective text areas, then press the "Obfuscate" button. The obfuscated code will be displayed in the text area below.

To deobfuscate an answer, enter the obfuscated answer in the "Answer to deobfuscate" text area and press the "Deobfuscate" button. The deobfuscated code will be displayed in the text area below.
